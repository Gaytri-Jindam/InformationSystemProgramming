A simple, responsive job search application built with HTML and CSS, designed to help users find job listings by applying search and filter criteria like job type and location.


**Search for Jobs:** Enter a keyword into the search bar (e.g., "Frontend Developer") and click "Search."
**Filter Jobs:** Use the filter panel to select a location or job type. Click "Apply Filters" to filter the job listings.
**View Job Details:** Review each job card for the job title, company, location, and type.
**Apply for a Job:** Click the "Apply Now" button on a job card to start the application process (this button is a placeholder and can be linked to a more detailed application page or an external job portal).
